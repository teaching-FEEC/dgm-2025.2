## Presentation

This project originated in the context of the graduate course *IA376N - Generative AI: from models to multimodal applications*, 
offered in the second semester of 2025, at Unicamp, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Paula Dornhofer Paro Costa, from the Department of Computer and Automation Engineering (DCA) of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (FEEC).

## Project Summary Description
> Description of the project theme, including generating context and motivation.  
> Description of the main goal of the project.  
> Clarify what the output of the generative model will be.  
>   
> Include in this section a link to the presentation video of the project proposal (maximum 5 minutes).

## Proposed Methodology
> For the first submission, the proposed methodology must clarify:  
> * Which dataset(s) the project intends to use, justifying the choice(s).  
> * Which generative modeling approaches the group already sees as interesting to be studied.  
> * Reference articles already identified and that will be studied or used as part of the project planning.  
> * Tools to be used (based on the group’s current vision of the project).  
> * Expected results.  
> * Proposal for evaluating the synthesis results.  

## Schedule
> Proposed schedule. Try to estimate how many weeks will be spent on each stage of the project.  

## Bibliographic References
> Point out in this section the bibliographic references adopted in the project.
