'''
Loss, that goes from patch to patch of the image(supposed 32x32 patches) 
and calculate the variance of pixels ( high variance = lots of different colors, low variance = few colors dominate the whole patch), 
then each patch is multiplied by a alpha variable(such as 5 or 10 or 100), 
calculate the MSE of the patch and divide by the alpha. 
For the whole image, we take a pondered weight of all MSEs
where patches with high variance have more weight and low variance less weight
